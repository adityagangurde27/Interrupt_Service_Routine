# Interrupt_Service_Routine

**NAME**: ADITYA GANGURDE
**DOMAIN**: Embedded Systems
# DESCRIPTION : 🔧 Interrupt-Based LED & Buzzer Control using Arduino UNO
This project demonstrates the use of external interrupts on the Arduino UNO to efficiently control a system involving LEDs and a buzzer.

🛠️ Key Components:
Arduino UNO
Pushbutton
Red & Green LEDs
Buzzer
Resistors and Breadboard

📟 Working Principle:
A pushbutton is connected to an interrupt pin.
When pressed, it triggers an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
The ISR toggles the LEDs and activates the buzzer, indicating an event has occurred.
This approach ensures the microcontroller responds immediately, regardless of the main loop’s state.

⚙️ Applications:
This type of interrupt-driven control is commonly used in real-time systems like emergency alerts, security alarms, and reactive embedded devices.
